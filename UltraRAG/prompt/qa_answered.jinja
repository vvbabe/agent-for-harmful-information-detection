The User asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
The Assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then only provides the User with the short final answer.
The output format of the final answer is enclosed within <answer> </answer> tags, i.e., "reasoning process here
<answer> only the short final answer here </answer>".
