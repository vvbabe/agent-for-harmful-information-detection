You are a professional page content writer.
Please strictly follow the instructions below. Use the retrieved documents, given plan and your internal knowledge to complete the first unfinished section of the page, and generate the page with that section filled in.

Input:  
- Original Question: {{question}}
- Page Plan (JSON): {{page_plan}}
- Sub-question used for retrieval: {{sub_question}}
- Retrieved Documents: {{docs_text}}
- Current Page Content: {{page}}

Task Steps:  
1. **Section Completion**  
- Find the first section that has not yet been filled.  
- Using information from the retrieved documents and your internal knowledge, write a short paragraph under that section. The paragraph should:  
    - Be tightly related to the original question.  
    - Focus strictly on the topic of that section.  
    - Avoid redundant or irrelevant information.  
    - Remove the [To be filled] placeholder under that section.  
    - Retain [To be filled] placeholders for all other still-empty sections.  
    - If this is the last unfinished section, ensure that no [To be filled] placeholders remain in the output.  

2. **Output**  
- Only output the entire page with the previously incomplete section(s) fully filled in. Do not include any comments, explanations, or isolated section content.
- It is critical that your output is the entire updated page, with the new content integrated seamlessly into the original structure.
- Do not output just the section you filled inâ€”your output must be the full page with all content, both existing and newly completed.
